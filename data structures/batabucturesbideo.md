### Data Structure Notes

#### Intro Notes
- Mathematical and logical models of data structures are abstract views or high level views
- Arrays and Lists are examples of Abstract Data Types
- A Linked List is another implementation of an ADT
> ADT Definition: Define data and operations, but no implementations yappity yappity

#### Lists
- List: Stores some elements, allows modification of itself and elements,reading and writing of elements, and yappity bappity
- Array Efficiency
    - If an array is full you can make another array double the size of the original and copy over the elements, then free the memory for the original array
    - This however is inefficient since inserting, removing, and copying elements takes time
    - Memory is also inefficiently allocated since all of the array may not be used 

#### Linked Lists
- Dynamic data structure that uses nodes to form sequenctial lists
- Each node is allocated space as it gets added to the list and each node points to the next node
- Each node is an element of a linked list and contains 2 values
    - The value of the node
    - The pointer, or link, to the next node in the linked list
    - The last node has a NULL pointer to indicate end of the list

#### Stacks
- Linear Data Structure
- Adding and removing elements are done at one end, known as the top of the stack

#### Queues
- Im too lazy to read allat 
- Ill add sum later TT

#### Trees
- Non-Linear Data Structure
- Collection of nodes
- Node Tree

#### Graphs
- Non-linear Data Structure
- Collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect those nodes
- Since nodes can have multiple connections to other nodes, graphs don't have a root node

#### WHAT THE FACK IS A BIG O
- hippity hoppity
- kms
- too much reading :(
- fuck omega and theta
